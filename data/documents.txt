The Airbus A320 is a narrow-body commercial aircraft developed by Airbus. 
It is widely used for short to medium-haul flights and can carry between 140 and 180 passengers depending on configuration. 
The A320 family includes the A318, A319, A320, and A321 models.

The Boeing 737 is one of the best-selling commercial aircraft in aviation history. 
It is produced by Boeing and is commonly used for regional and short-haul routes. 
The 737 MAX is the latest generation of this aircraft family.

The standard takeoff speed (V1) is the decision speed during takeoff. 
If an engine failure occurs before V1, the takeoff can be rejected. 
After V1, the pilot must continue the takeoff.

Rotation speed (VR) is the speed at which the pilot initiates aircraft rotation during takeoff. 
V2 is the takeoff safety speed that must be maintained after liftoff in case of engine failure.

In aviation meteorology, cumulonimbus clouds are associated with thunderstorms, heavy rain, turbulence, and icing. 
Pilots must avoid flying directly through cumulonimbus clouds due to severe weather hazards.

Wind shear is a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance. 
It is particularly dangerous during takeoff and landing phases.

Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) allow pilots to fly in low visibility conditions using cockpit instruments. 
Visual Flight Rules (VFR) require sufficient visibility and visual reference to the ground.

A holding pattern is a racetrack-shaped maneuver used by aircraft while waiting for clearance to land. 
It consists of inbound and outbound legs with standard rate turns.

The Minimum Equipment List (MEL) specifies which aircraft equipment may be inoperative for a flight to be dispatched legally.

Crew Resource Management (CRM) focuses on communication, leadership, and decision-making in the cockpit to improve flight safety.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) establishes global aviation safety standards and recommended practices.

Stall occurs when the angle of attack exceeds the critical angle, resulting in a loss of lift. 
Recovery requires reducing the angle of attack and applying appropriate power.

Jet engines operate based on the principle of thrust generation by accelerating air rearward. 
The four main stages are intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust.

A standard instrument departure (SID) is a published departure procedure followed after takeoff. 
A standard terminal arrival route (STAR) is used during the arrival phase before landing.

The transponder code 7700 indicates a general emergency. 
Code 7600 indicates radio communication failure. 
Code 7500 indicates unlawful interference (hijacking).
